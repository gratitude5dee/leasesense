LeaseSense delivers “energy equity without ownership.” In minutes, tenants authenticate a utility or smart plug, pick “Home” or “Shop,” and receive a dashboard that:
	•	Explains every dollar & kWh in plain language. Utility data is fetched via Bayou’s one‑click OAuth (<60 s) and normalized to 15‑min intervals, meeting Green‑Button standards.  
	•	Benchmarks performance against anonymized peers (renters vs. cafés) using EIA RECS and CBECS medians.   
	•	Recommends low‑lift actions (shift laundry, stagger espresso machines) engineered from NILM‑disaggregated device estimates.  
	•	Generates shareable “Impact Proofs”—print‑friendly certificates that boost tenant–landlord conversations or green‑marketing for stores.
	•	Surfaces rebates & C‑PACE financing paths when bigger upgrades make sense.
